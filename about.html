      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div><p>At the heart of our work is a simple intention: to bring mindfulness into everyday life as a source of healing, clarity, and resilience.</p>
<p>Founded by <strong>Shrujal Shah</strong>, a certified mindfulness teacher with over 3 years of experience, we have guided more than 100 individuals on their journey to reduce anxiety, manage depression, heal trauma, and cultivate inner balance. Our approach is compassionate and trauma-informed, creating a safe and supportive space for both individuals and groups.</p>
<p>We offer personalized mindfulness practices that blend guided meditation, breathwork, mindful movement, visualization, and reflective journaling. Each session is structured with care—beginning with an assessment, moving through guided practice, and concluding with follow-up support—to ensure lasting impact.</p>
<p>Our community extends beyond individual practice. Through our mindfulness sangha of 80+ members, we foster a sense of belonging and emotional connection where participants can share, heal, and grow together. We also bring mindfulness into schools, helping children develop focus, self-awareness, and emotional resilience at an early age.</p>
<p>Whether you are seeking to find calm amidst daily stress, deepen your meditation practice, or heal through compassionate awareness, we are here to walk alongside you.</p></div>
