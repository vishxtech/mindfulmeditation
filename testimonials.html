I‚Äôve been fortunate to have met Shrujal online and attend her mindfulness meditation classes. It‚Äôs difficult to customise classes to each attendees needs but Shrujal makes it a point to understand everyone‚Äôs needs through personal one on one support; she goes out of her way to offer empathy and kindness and spends enough time in class with each student to bring them up to speed. I recommend her classes to all working professionals who are navigating stress everyday."</p>

      <p>"Joining mindfulness sessions with Shrujal has been a truly transformative experience. Two meditations that deeply resonated with me were the rain and mountain meditations both incredibly grounding and peaceful.

The rain meditation felt like an emotional cleanse, washing away inner tension. The mountain meditation helped me feel strong, steady, and rooted like a calm presence within myself no matter what‚Äôs happening around me.

What stands out most is that through these sessions, I‚Äôve noticed a real shift in my mental health journey. I feel more balanced, more mindful and more in tune with my inner world.

Even though it‚Äôs all online, the energy and connection are powerful. I‚Äôm truly grateful to Shrujal for these moments of stillness, clarity, and healing.I highly recommend this sessions to anyone seeking peace, healing, and inner strength."</p>

      <p>One of my  friend referred me to Shrujal meditation classes. I wanted to say Thank you for divine gift of healing you gave us through your meditation classes. I‚Äôm grateful for being part of your classes. I‚Äôm learning so incredibly much on how to deal with our daily challenges though our weekend classes. Shrujal is very good knowledge on breathing exercises and some techniques to reduce stress and compulsive behaviors. 
Her classes very practical and easily applicable for our everyday tasks. Shrujal teaches 15-20min at the beginning of every class and then we go to meditation session for the rest of the class. She cares about each and every person and asks how they are feeling during this meditation process. I‚Äôm in her advanced class now. I can see myself lot of improvement compared to me in the beginning classes. I highly recommend Shrujal if you‚Äôre seeking guidance in meditation. "</p>
